This project consists of two tasks that involve website development and testing with Selenium IDE.

## Task 1: Website Development

### Overview
The user interface of this website resembles Service Symphony, with variations in color palettes, images, logos, content, and orientation. It consists of four sections: Home, Services, Blog, and Contact. Version 1 and Version 2 have specific differences detailed below:

### Version 1 UI
- Home
- Services
- Blog
- Contact

### Version 2 UI
- Home
- Services
- Blog
- Contact

### Changes in Version 2
1. Top navigation bar color changed from #0069d9 to #000.
2. 'Read More' from Home page now navigates to Blog instead of Services.
3. Positions of the buttons below 'Subscribe to get out Newsletter' have been interchanged.
4. Text box location in the 'Contact' page has been interchanged.

## Task 2: Selenium IDE Testing Tool

### Selenium IDE Overview
Selenium IDE is a user-friendly web application automation tool, functioning as a browser extension. It enables the recording, modification, and playback of user interactions. It simplifies test script creation without extensive programming knowledge.

### Assessment of the Testing Tool
1. **Features and Functionalities:** Selenium IDE offers record-and-playback, debugging capabilities, and script customization. Test cases can be exported to Selenium WebDriver-supported programming languages.
2. **Coverage:** Basic element interactions are supported (e.g., clicks, typing, dropdown selections), aiding in browser compatibility testing.
3. **Reusing Test Cases:** Direct test case reuse within Selenium IDE is limited; adjustments are required for additional instances.
4. **Test Results:** Basic logs and reports are available via the Selenium IDE interface, but detailed reporting may necessitate integration with other tools or frameworks.
5. **Usages:** Ideal for beginners in automated testing, especially for those lacking extensive programming skills. The user-friendly interface simplifies test case creation.
6. **GUIs Tested:** Handles simple GUI elements well but may encounter difficulties with complex interactions or validations.
